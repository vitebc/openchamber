# OpenChamber Agent Guide

## Purpose

OpenChamber provides shared web, desktop, VS Code, hosted-mobile, and native-mobile UI surfaces for OpenCode.

This file contains only always-on repository rules and routing. Detailed workflows belong to project skills and module documentation.

## Instruction Order

These steps are mandatory. Before editing, you **MUST**:

1. Follow this root guide.
2. Load every matching project skill and every task-required reference from
   those skills.
3. Read the nearest `DOCUMENTATION.md` and package `README.md` when present.
4. Follow local code and test precedent.

If these sources materially conflict, stop and resolve the conflict instead of silently choosing one.
Do not start editing when a matching skill or required reference has not been
read. Skill loading is a required part of the task, not optional guidance.

## Runtime Boundaries

- `packages/ui`: shared React UI, state, sync, and runtime contracts.
- `packages/web`: web surfaces, OpenChamber server, managed/external OpenCode lifecycle, and CLI.
- `packages/electron`: native desktop shell and privileged Electron boundary.
- `packages/vscode`: extension host, webview, and runtime bridge.
- `packages/mobile`: Capacitor iOS/Android shell; bundles the mobile web surface and connects to an existing OpenChamber server.
- `packages/docs`: product documentation; not a Bun workspace.
- `packages/sdk`: guest contract for third-party panels. Manifest parse, iframe envelope, `connectHost`. Host and guest import from here; do not copy these types into `packages/ui`.
- `packages/extensions`: app-owned SDK extensions and their build registry, not a Bun workspace. See its `DOCUMENTATION.md` for trust, packaging, and migration rules.

Shared UI calls official OpenCode APIs through `@opencode/client` (OpenCode 2.x) via `opencodeClient`; wire shapes stay inside `packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/`. OpenChamber-owned capabilities use `RuntimeAPIs`, `runtimeFetch`, and shared browser/realtime transport helpers. Server-side upstream integrations may use their owning runtime modules.

Electron starts the OpenChamber backend in-process, never as a sidecar. Development may load loopback/HMR UI; packaged builds load staged assets through `openchamber-ui://` while the loopback server remains the API backend. Keep domain backends in web/runtime modules unless behavior is inherently native.

Shared contracts must define intentional behavior for every applicable runtime: web, desktop, VS Code, hosted mobile, and Capacitor mobile.

## Always-On Constraints

- Do not modify `../opencode`; it is a separate repository.
- Do not run git or GitHub commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not add dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Never add or log secrets, bearer tokens, pairing credentials, or sensitive user data.
- Keep changes minimal and preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Release notes are the maintainer's release-time work: they get written once, as one story, in `changelog/unreleased.md` when the maintainer asks to update the changelog. Until that request, treat `changelog/` as read-only — a fix, feature, or merged PR lands without a changelog line. `packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md` and `changelog/index.json` are generated from `changelog/*.md` by `oc-dev create-release`, and `CHANGELOG.md` is a legacy copy for older installs: never edit or regenerate any of them; an agent's only changelog output is `changelog/unreleased.md`.
- Enforce security and correctness in core/runtime logic, not only UI visibility or prompts.
- Keep entrypoints and bridges thin; place domain logic in focused owning modules.
- Update owning documentation when module ownership, contracts, or invariants change.

## Correctness Invariants

- Prefer authoritative state over heuristics.
- Derive live activity from live channels, not persisted history.
- Scope temporary fallbacks narrowly and clear them when authoritative state arrives.
- Never let fetch failure masquerade as authoritative empty success.
- Make partial results, rollback, cleanup, and stale-data behavior explicit.
- One failed entity must not erase or block unrelated complete entities.
- Runtime-specific differences must be intentional and visible in code.

## Communication

You and the maintainer are two people solving a problem together — talk like a trusted colleague, not a report generator. Plain words, short sentences, mechanisms explained through what the user experiences. Warm and direct, never familiar. A reply is something read in minutes, not a separate reading task: put the conclusion first and stand behind it. Answer in the language the maintainer addressed you in; code, comments, and docs stay in English.

When writing or editing user-facing text — docs, UI copy, PR/issue comments, READMEs — load `.agents/skills/communication-style/SKILL.md` and apply its checklist.

## Documentation Discovery

Before changing a module, search for the nearest `DOCUMENTATION.md`; before package-level work, read its `README.md`. Discover docs dynamically under `packages/**/DOCUMENTATION.md` rather than relying on a static exhaustive map.

High-value anchors:

- Sync: `packages/ui/src/sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Stores: `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- CLI: `packages/web/bin/lib/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Performance measurement tooling: `scripts/perf/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- VS Code runtime: `packages/vscode/src/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Electron: `packages/electron/README.md`
- Mobile: `packages/mobile/README.md`
- SDK: `packages/sdk/DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Localization (i18n)

All user-facing text lives in `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/`; every runtime (web, desktop, VS Code, mobile) consumes the shared UI. The `locale-ui-patterns` skill is canonical for string and key rules — never hardcode UI strings or ship English placeholders in non-English dictionaries.

- Each locale is two files: `messages/<locale>.ts` (`dict`) and `messages/<locale>.settings.ts` (`settingsDict`, spread into `dict`). Feature strings live in `messages/*.i18n.ts` modules (one object per locale, spread into the dicts: 8 into `dict`, 3 into `settingsDict`); each module has a `*.i18n.test.ts` parity test. Every dictionary must have exactly the same keys as `en.ts`; `messages.test.ts` enforces this parity for each registered dictionary.
- Adding a locale (e.g. `ru`) means editing every file in `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/`, not just creating `messages/ru.ts`:
  - `runtime.ts`: `Locale` union, `LOCALES`, `LOCALE_LABEL_KEYS` (add a `common.language.*` key to the union and maps), and `normalizeLocale` browser-language mapping.
  - `store.ts`: add the locale to the hand-written lazy `import('./messages/...')` chain in `loadDictionary`.
  - `bootstrap.ts`: add `<LOCALE>_MESSAGES` plus a `BOOTSTRAP_MESSAGES` entry — these strings render before the main dictionary loads (startup/connecting screens). Mirror the new locale in `packages/vscode/src/webviewHtml.ts` (`getBootstrapMessages`), which carries its own splash-string subset.
  - `intl.ts`: map the locale to a BCP-47 tag (`ru` → `ru-RU`).
  - `messages.test.ts`: import the new dict and register it in `localeDictionaries`.
  - Every `messages/*.i18n.ts` module: add a `<locale>` block with real translations, and add the locale to the `locales` array in its `*.i18n.test.ts`.
- Module tests forbid values identical to English except for keys they explicitly exempt (brand names like `Linear`, the `usage-stats` `SAME_AS_ENGLISH` set); transliterating a product name to dodge the check is a defect — product names stay literal per `locale-ui-patterns`, and only test-exempted keys may match English.
- Any key added to `en.ts` (e.g. `common.language.russian`) must also be added to every other dictionary or the parity test fails.
- The Settings language picker is driven by `LOCALES` + `LOCALE_LABEL_KEYS`, so a new locale appears automatically once registered.
- Locale persists under localStorage key `openchamber.i18n.v1` (`runtime.ts`) and switches re-render through `useI18n()` without a remount.
- i18n tests use `bun:test` with no npm script; run `bun test` scoped to `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/` plus `bun run type-check:ui`.

## Project Skills

Project skills live under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. You **MUST** load every
skill matching the character of the change before editing; multiple skills may
apply, including companion skills required by another skill. Read every
task-required reference named by those skills. Skills are canonical for their
detailed workflows and checklists. Treating this table as optional advice is a
process violation.


| Trigger | Required skill |
|---|---|
| Source/dependency changes, exports or package contracts, build/generated assets, or module ownership | `openchamber-change-discipline` |
| CLI commands, prompts, terminal output, non-TTY, `--quiet`, or `--json` behavior | `clack-cli-patterns` |
| Shared UI data access, OpenCode SDK or server routes, `RuntimeAPIs`, runtime auth/URLs, bridges, or runtime switching | `ui-api-decoupling` |
| Electron main/preload, IPC, native UI, updater, deep links, SSH/tunnels, packaging, or child processes | `desktop-shell` |
| Session sync, bootstrap/reconnect, reducers, polling, optimistic state, queues, live status, reconciliation, or directory-scoped caches | `sync-state-invariants` |
| Isolated-space trust boundaries: hardening, networks and gatekeeper policy, exec and lifecycle, grants and credentials, code transfer and apply, dispatcher isolation, preview content, or protection tests | `isolated-space-boundary` |
| Render/store/event hot paths, large lists, caches/indexes, or reported lag, freezes, CPU/memory, startup, or performance regressions | `performance-engineering` |
| WebSocket, SSE, streaming transport, runtime transport internals, or private relay | `relay-transport` |
| UI components, styling, colors, buttons, or icons | `theme-system` |
| User-facing or accessible UI text, labels, aria, toasts, dialogs, or navigation copy | `locale-ui-patterns` |
| Settings UI, settings dialogs, configuration surfaces, or settings search | `settings-ui-patterns` |
| Sortable or drag-to-reorder behavior, especially `@dnd-kit` and touch/wrapping layouts | `drag-to-reorder` |
| iOS Simulator build, launch, preview, gestures, or `serve-sim` control | `serve-sim` |
| The maintainer explicitly asks to update the changelog (main app or VS Code extension) — the only time `changelog/unreleased.md` is edited | `update-changelog` |
| Creating or editing skills, `AGENTS.md`, or docs reached through agent instructions/context pointers | `writing-for-agents` |
| OpenCode routes, events, message/session shapes, plugins, the pinned OpenCode version, "what's new in OpenCode 2.0.x", or a bug that looks like OpenCode behaving unexpectedly | `opencode-v2` |
| Reviewing a single pull request or drafting a PR verdict/close/review comment | `pr-review` |
| Triaging, cleaning up, or batch-processing the open PR queue | `triage-prs` |
| Triaging, cleaning up, or batch-processing the issue backlog | `triage-issues` |

Pure code-reading or explanation does not require implementation skills unless needed to interpret a specialized subsystem.

### Skill Ownership

Keep each cross-cutting rule with one canonical owner; companion skills add only domain-specific consequences and a pointer to that owner.

| Concern | Canonical skill |
|---|---|
| Change scope, abstraction discipline, and validation risk | `openchamber-change-discipline` |
| State authority, reconciliation, optimistic state, and lifecycle correctness | `sync-state-invariants` |
| Isolated-space trust boundaries and the evidence that each one holds | `isolated-space-boundary` |
| Measurement, hot-path cost, caching performance, and optimization evidence | `performance-engineering` |
| Shared UI API and runtime boundaries | `ui-api-decoupling` |
| WebSocket/SSE and private relay mechanics | `relay-transport` |
| Electron native ownership and privilege boundary | `desktop-shell` |
| UI tokens, primitives, icons, and animation styling | `theme-system` |
| Settings composition and search behavior | `settings-ui-patterns` |
| User-facing text and localization | `locale-ui-patterns` |
| Agent-facing document structure and context pointers | `writing-for-agents` |

Before adding guidance to a skill, identify its canonical owner. If another skill owns the rule, add a precise companion pointer and only the local consequence; do not copy the rule.

## Validation

- Use `package.json` scripts as the command source of truth.
- Prefer focused tests and package-scoped type-check/lint for executable source changes.
- Use workspace-wide checks for cross-workspace contracts, root tooling, dependencies, or shared generated assets.
- Run `bun run dead-code` when source files are added/deleted/renamed or exports, types, entrypoints, or import shape change; inspect its report because it is non-blocking.
- Run `bunx oxlint <changed-paths>` on TypeScript/JavaScript files you created or substantially rewrote. This runs the vendored `anti-slop` plugin, which rejects low-evidence typing: unjustified type assertions, `unknown`/`object`/`Record<string, unknown>` contracts, ad hoc `typeof` narrowing, and module mocking. Fix findings in code you authored. Pre-existing findings elsewhere are a known backlog: do not mass-fix them, and never silence a rule, weaken severity, or launder types to make the check pass.
- Do not assume TypeScript/lint covers server JS, CLI JS, Electron helpers, or native behavior; run focused tests, syntax checks, builds, or runtime validation for the touched surface.
- For docs-only or isolated config changes, run the narrowest relevant validation.
- Report exactly what was and was not validated. Static checks alone do not prove runtime, relay, performance, or platform correctness.

## Pull Request Handoff

Before creating or updating a pull request, read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Complete the template with concrete,
current evidence for the final PR HEAD; do not make the reviewer reconstruct
intent, affected surfaces, validation, visual behavior, or failure and
rollback considerations from the diff alone.

A **product decision** belongs to the maintainer and is settled before the code,
never inside the diff. A product decision is anything where two reasonable people
could disagree about whether it should exist or how it should behave: a new
button, panel, setting or command; a changed default; a shortcut or gesture that
now does something else; different wording, ordering or grouping in the UI;
anything that turns existing behavior on or off for everyone. Removing or
bypassing behavior the code marks as deliberate is one too, and there the first
question is whether it is a defect at all. A crash, wrong data, behavior that
contradicts what it plainly claims, or a performance fix that keeps behavior
identical is a bug, not a product decision.

Where that decision is settled depends on who is working:

- **Working with the maintainer or a team member** (anyone with repository
  access): raise the product question in the session and get an answer there.
  The decision already happened off GitHub; no discussion thread and no link is
  expected on the pull request.
- **Working as an outside contributor**: the decision happens in an agreed
  [Ideas discussion](https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber/discussions/categories/ideas)
  before the code, linked from the pull request. Without the maintainer's
  go-ahead such a pull request is not reviewed, and a discussion opened
  afterwards to describe finished work is closed along with it.

When the call is unclear, ask before building. Deciding it silently is the one
thing that is always wrong.
