## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-23

### New

- **OpenCode 2:** the extension now runs on OpenCode 2, so skills, agents, commands, MCP servers and plugins apply as soon as you save them. With OpenCode 1.x installed, it shows a screen to update, with one-click install. [Read the story on our blog](https://openchamber.dev/blog/opencode-v2/).
- **Code Mode:** the agent can call your MCP tools and plugin tools from one short script, and the chat shows a Script row with every call it made.
- Chat: fork a session from an agent answer.

### Improvements

- Chat: permission requests and forms appear above the message box, and forms walk through their questions one step at a time.
- Chat: web search results show as cards with the site, title, date and snippet.
- Sessions: optional animated activity indicators show running sessions in the sidebar and switcher (thanks to @mattv8).

## [1.24.2] - 2026-09-18

### Fixes

- Chat: malformed Markdown stays readable as plain text without crashing the chat.
- Chat: switching agents respects each agent's pinned model and thinking level (thanks to @maxiedaniels).
- Chat: context usage reflects the model that wrote the latest answer.
- Sessions: Rename closes the session menu and opens the name field again (thanks to @karimodm).
- Agent Manager: renamed multi-run sessions keep their group, and separate launches with the same label stay separate (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Worktrees: Enter creates a worktree once from the branch or directory field; confirming text with an input method doesn't create it early.
- Chat: math formulas use the correct KaTeX fonts (thanks to @Dawnfz-Lenfeng).

- Settings/Usage: Gemini 3.x models such as Gemini 3.1 Pro are included in the initial model selection (thanks to @DeryFerd).

## [1.24.0] - 2026-09-17

### Improvements

- Chat: Agent labels and icons use more distinct colors from your VS Code theme.

- Sessions: Archived subagents no longer reappear as active after an older refresh completes (thanks to @yulia-ivashko and @alexandrereyes).
- Settings/Projects: Project names keep the letters you type, and renaming preserves the default model and thinking setting (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).

- Chat: The first model you add to favorites stays saved after reloading the panel (thanks to @alvins82).
- Chat: Reloading panels or moving them between windows now closes old background connections, fixing a connection leak.

- Settings: "Always show scrollbars" keeps scrollbars visible when the pointer leaves a scrollable area.

### Improvements

- **Chat:** `/btw` now has a separate composer with its own draft, model, and effort. The "By the way…" text-selection action prefills a question with the selected passage (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: Completed live Activity can collapse into a tool and file-change summary while the final answer stays visible, following your Activity Default setting.
- Settings: VS Code keeps its own appearance and chat layout preferences, separate from web, desktop, and mobile.
- Settings: In narrow panels, Back returns from an item to its list before returning to the settings menu.
- Chat: Ctrl+N/P navigation works across model lists, menus, and autocomplete. The model picker reopens with your selected model in view (thanks to @ChangeHow).

- Chat: Message details adapt to narrow panels without leaving gaps between the model, effort, and duration.
- Chat: Long Thinking output stays in a capped scroll box while streaming; scrolling upward pauses its automatic scrolling (thanks to @alvins82).
- Chat: Narrow tables keep their border and toolbar close to the columns (thanks to @ChangeHow).

- Usage: OpenRouter reports key spending and limits accurately, including monthly spending for unlimited keys (thanks to @leducmaxime).
- Usage: Ollama Cloud dollar-based plans show monthly spending and extra credits; credential checks reject unreadable usage pages (thanks to @kydorn).
- Usage: NeuralWatt shows allowance percentages correctly in both used and remaining modes (thanks to @kydorn).
- Usage: Provider requests have enough time to connect on slower networks, fixing premature "fetch failed" errors (thanks to @ouyangjian28).
- Scrollbars: Hover reveals scrollbars in chat, Settings, and shared dialogs without moving the content sideways (thanks to @sergiofspedro).
- Language/Turkish: Activity and input-history settings use consistent agent and prompt terminology (thanks to @fitzgpt).

## [1.22.2] - 2026-09-05

### New

- **Comments on code.** Select lines, click the `+` in the gutter or right-click → OpenChamber → Add Comment, and write your note. It stays pinned to the code and goes out with your next message as a context card. Works in diffs too (thanks to @felipegenef).
- The extension is available in Turkish (thanks to @fitzgpt).
- Chat: prompt history. Arrow up and down in the composer bring back your earlier prompts, attachments included, and the history survives a reload. It covers the current session; Settings → Chat can widen it to every project and set how many prompts to keep, 40 by default (thanks to @mattv8).
- Chat: an "Enter sends" switch in Settings → Chat. On, Enter sends and Shift+Enter adds a line; off, the other way round. Ctrl/Cmd+Enter always sends. Nothing changes until you flip it (thanks to @claymor333).

### Improvements

- Chat: Markdown tables are readable again, columns take the width their content needs (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: the Summary, Tree, or Raw view you pick for a JSON tool result is remembered for every JSON card and after a reload (thanks to @karimodm).

- Chat: pressing Enter to confirm text on a Japanese, Chinese, or Korean keyboard no longer sends a comment by accident (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Goal Mode: when a reply is cut off by the length limit, the goal continues, and Resume gives it another try (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sessions: subagent sessions are found in projects with more than 200 sessions (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Permission auto-accept works again with the stable OpenCode (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- On Windows, the status command and adding a folder to the workspace handle drive-letter case correctly (thanks to @pttydou).

## [1.22.1] - 2026-09-04

### New

- Settings: Fixel Text is available as an interface font.
- Usage: exe.dev usage windows are tracked.

### Improvements

- **OpenCode Go:** the usage request the extension sends now carries the `x-opencode-session` header OpenCode Go requires from 6 September. Chat traffic already had it.
- Chat: a queued message keeps its attached context, file mentions, and skill, and editing it brings them back to the composer.
- Sessions: starting a rename selects the whole title (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).

### Fixes

- Worktrees: removing a worktree no longer freezes the interface. It runs in the background with a progress toast (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Worktrees: a worktree created from a branch behind its upstream now fetches first and branches from the remote (thanks to @jtatum).
- Worktrees: the New Worktree dialog keeps what you typed when the worktree list changes while it is open (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Worktrees: a removed worktree leaves the sidebar under every project it was listed in (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Thinking effort: picking Default sticks after a send and across agent or session switches, and a reopened session restores the effort its last message used (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Settings: the theme no longer flips when you switch sessions across directories, and a theme the extension cannot fully report keeps your current preference (thanks to @kydorn).

### Misc

- The Settings Integrations page, which offered the Claude Code and Cursor plugin installs, is gone.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-08-30

### Improvements

- **Chat:** a session you open from the sidebar lands at its end and stays there. Switching sessions no longer jumps or renders half a conversation.

### Fixes

- Chat: a turn that OpenCode stopped no longer ends with nothing on screen. What OpenCode reported shows under the last message, and a message an idle session left unanswered is named as such.
- Chat: the status report (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L) lists the last session errors and rejected sends.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-08-29

### New

- **Turkish interface:** OpenChamber can be used in Turkish (thanks to @fitzgpt).
- Composer: pasting a big block of text offers to attach it as a `pasted-context-N.txt` file and leaves a reference at the caret. Settings → Chat can make it always attach or always paste inline (thanks to @makeittech).
- Multi-Run: a group can hold more than five models (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat: a tool card with a file path has a quick-open button that opens the file in the editor (thanks to @robertoberto).

### Improvements

- Context usage reports a session's cost including everything its subagents spent (thanks to @igorvelho).
- Chat: the text the model writes before it asks a question appears right away instead of waiting until the turn ends (thanks to @makeittech).
- Usage: GitHub Copilot shows a single AI Credits window matching Copilot's token-based quota (thanks to @jakoss).
- The extension reuses its OpenCode output channel across managed-server restarts instead of making duplicates (thanks to @TTTPOB).

### Fixes

- **Chat:** a very large tool result is capped before it renders, so it no longer freezes the panel (thanks to @JSap0914).
- Chat: a code block with JavaScript template strings no longer sends the highlighter into endless backtracking (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: a diff with a truncated header no longer crashes the conversation (thanks to @pascalandr).
- Chat: a draft or recalled message with Windows line endings no longer throws "Selection points outside of document" every time you open it (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Chat: a session no longer looks frozen after the webview reloads or opens late. Pending permission and question cards come back (thanks to @yangyaofei).
- Chat: a session no longer looks frozen after you dismiss the agent's questions and send a new task (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: when the turn-ending signal from OpenCode is lost, the working spinner clears within about a second instead of up to ten (thanks to @makeittech).
- `/btw` side questions: a btw session answers the side question instead of carrying on with the parent's plan, and it forks at the last completed turn, so it never inherits a reply that is still streaming (thanks to @pocharlies).
- Composer: typing three backticks leaves the caret inside the finished code fence, an empty input keeps a visible caret, and platform autocorrect behaves as it should (thanks to @franzudev, @TTTPOB, and @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat scrolling: with "Follow new content while streaming" off, sending while scrolled up leaves the view where it is, and a middle-button pan or Shift+Space stops auto-follow the way the wheel does (thanks to @pascalandr).
- Chat scrolling: PageUp/PageDown in the prompt box no longer shifts the whole panel up.
- Chat: question prompts render Markdown (thanks to @pascalandr).
- Chat: a bare link next to CJK or full-width punctuation no longer swallows it (thanks to @gaojunran).
- Chat: inline code, chips, and model-picker highlights stay readable in high-contrast themes (thanks to @difagume and @bashrusakh).
- Chat: a finished reasoning block shows in full instead of replaying, the text-selection menu stays inside the window, and the sticky user-message header no longer fades over the reply (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: sending without a selected model says what is missing (thanks to @rvaldemar).
- Chat: `/init` stays in slash-command autocomplete after the conversation starts (thanks to @Dawnfz-Lenfeng).
- Chat: copying a message keeps Markdown spacing (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: a model you picked by hand survives switching between Build and Plan (thanks to @makeittech).
- Updates: updating OpenCode no longer fails with a bare "Bad Request". The extension names the release it will install and shows OpenCode's reason when it refuses (thanks to @mdatsev and @yulia-ivashko).
- "Add Project" adds the folder you chose to the workspace instead of failing (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- The extension starts in the current workspace folder instead of one restored from storage (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sidebar: pending permission and question badges are no longer covered by the hover actions (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sidebar: worktree branch search hides branches that do not match (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Settings/Providers: after you save an API key or sign in, the provider no longer shows "Credentials missing" with its models hidden until you switch away and back (thanks to @herjarsa).
- Settings: number fields and selects no longer clip at large font sizes (thanks to @makeittech).
- Settings: Windows skill paths are classified correctly, so disabled and duplicate skills are hidden as intended (thanks to @Ttungx).
- Windows: closing VS Code stops the managed OpenCode process instead of leaving it running (thanks to @a0000001).
- Work status: undoing or redoing a parent session keeps its subagents at the same point in history (thanks to @alexandrereyes).

## [1.21.0] - 2026-08-26

### New

- **Chat: comment on a reply.** Select text in a chat message and choose Comment to attach that quote with your note to the next message. The selection stays highlighted while you type.
- Chat: context attachments. Diff and file comments, terminal selections, and linked issues and pull requests show as compact context cards, with a source header, the captured content behind an expander, and your comment below.
- Composer: hovering a context chip above the input opens a stacked preview of everything attached, where you can edit comments in place or remove items before sending.
- Permission cards answer to the keyboard. Alt+Enter allows once, Alt+Shift+Enter allows always, Alt+Backspace denies, and the keys are printed on the buttons.

### Improvements

- Chat: @ file mentions rank files and directories together by how well they match, so the file you typed is at the top. Multi-word queries match in any order, and a long path keeps the folder next to the file name visible.
- Search: Ctrl/Cmd+P matches the whole file path, so searching a folder name finds the files inside it.
- Search: pickers for agents, models, providers, and branches put the best matches first, match multi-word queries in any order, and ignore punctuation, so "gpt4o" finds "gpt-4o".
- Keyboard: dropdowns and pickers answer Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P for down and up, the session switcher opens focused on your current session, and shortcut labels show the binding you have set (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+T cycles through every thinking level the selected model offers instead of stopping at the end (thanks to @nimobeeren).
- Chat: OpenCode notices share one style.

### Fixes

- Chat: the view no longer sticks on its loading screen on slow or remote connections, including code-server behind a reverse proxy (thanks to @VinciYan).
- Chat: the timeline dialog fits small windows instead of squeezing the message list to a couple of rows (thanks to @gaojunran).

## [1.20.0] - 2026-08-23

### New

- **/btw side questions:** type `/btw` and your question to ask something off-topic in a temporary session forked from the current one. The answer streams into a panel above the composer, which you can collapse, keep as a full session, or discard without touching the chat (thanks to @jaygupta17).
- Skills catalog: browse curated GitHub skill collections in a card catalog with search across sources and a link to each skill's repository.
- Settings/Projects: a project can pin a thinking level next to its model, for models that offer levels.
- Chat: an app link such as `spotify://` asks for confirmation before opening another app. You can trust a link type on one device and manage trusted links in Settings.
- Providers: more custom providers are supported.

### Improvements

- Settings: the workspace selector on Providers, Agents, MCP, Commands, and Skills only changes what those pages show, instead of moving the chat, session list, and file tree to another workspace.
- Chat: while a reply streams, the model status line under the last message turns into the finished message's info row in place.
- Usage: Z.ai credit limits appear alongside its other quota windows.
- UI: the default dialog close button is easier to click or tap (thanks to @rockinrimmer).

### Fixes

- Settings/General: changing the default model, variant, or agent no longer repoints an open chat that already carries a model you picked for it. Chats following the default still switch right away.
- Settings/Providers: the provider you select no longer jumps to another one when the chat selection or provider data changes.
- Chat: if OpenCode restarts while a response is running, the chat stops with an interrupted state and a notification to continue instead of hanging silently (thanks to @sum117).
- Chat: newly sent messages and highlighted code blocks no longer flicker, and Bash output grows with its content instead of being cut off.
- Chat: file paths in messages open from the session's workspace, even if you last browsed files in another workspace (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat: a long user message can be expanded even when its final layout finishes after it first appears.
- Sidebar: sessions created outside OpenChamber appear in the sidebar and Recent list without a page refresh (thanks to @tomzx).

### Misc

- Settings/Integrations: the experimental page lists only integrations you can install. Unavailable and Coming soon entries are gone.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-19

### New

- **Settings/Integrations:** a new Integrations page lists the Claude Code, Command Code and Cursor plugins with install, update, setup and remove actions. Discord and Telegram are marked coming soon.
- Usage: Command Code plan limits appear in the Usage page and the work status panel.

### Improvements

- Usage: the context readout in the chat header shows the session's cost in its tooltip (thanks to @YunFeng0817).
- Attachments: text pulled out of Office and OpenDocument files is capped and shown more compactly, so a large document and its images no longer crowd out the rest of the message.

### Fixes

- **Chat:** an open conversation no longer keeps re-coloring the same code blocks in the background, which drove CPU use up while the chat sat idle (thanks to @makeittech).
- Settings: saving settings no longer wipes an OpenCode config written with unquoted JSON5 keys down to an empty `$schema` stub. Plugins, MCP servers and providers stay, and the change reports a failure (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: a new chat no longer saves its first message and then never starts when the last worktree directory was deleted; it falls back to the active project.
- Chat: typing with Chinese, Japanese or Korean input methods no longer breaks composition or throws the cursor to the end of the composer (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: the context readout no longer climbs past 100% after turns with many tool calls, and no longer jumps when you reopen an older session (thanks to @pocharlies).
- Projects: project names match the folder name exactly, so `.ssh` and `opencode-claude` no longer read as `.Ssh` and `Opencode Claude`. Names you set yourself are kept.
- Add Project adds the chosen folder to the workspace instead of showing a "Failed to add project" toast.
- The model menu no longer paints white text on a white highlight in a high-contrast theme, so the hovered or selected model stays readable (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Skills Catalog: the misspelled source name ClawdHub now reads ClawHub (thanks to @makeittech).

## [1.18.4] - 2026-08-14

### Fixes

- **Chat:** new messages no longer jump above older ones once the message ID sequence rolls over. Loading history, reverting and redoing follow the same order as the conversation.

## [1.18.3] - 2026-08-14

### Improvements

- Chat images: a finished assistant reply collects its Markdown images into a compact gallery with thumbnails and full-screen previews, including workspace images across multi-root workspaces (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: the Focus Chat command and the Add to Context action put the cursor in the chat input, so you can keep typing.
- Usage: quota limits you chose to display refresh every three minutes, and you can refresh them by hand at any time.
- Usage: OpenCode Go quota tracking uses your existing OpenCode API key. No browser cookies or workspace ID needed.

### Fixes

- Sessions: switching projects selects a session that belongs to the new workspace (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: a message you already submitted stays with its session; a later project switch no longer sends it somewhere else (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: typing `!` for shell mode no longer leaves the `!` in the command or puts the caret on the wrong side of it (thanks to @RyderAsKing).
- Chat: line numbers with three or more digits no longer wrap in code blocks (thanks to @ChangeHow).

## [1.18.2] - 2026-08-10

### New

- Usage: xAI quota reporting (thanks to @iamhenry).

### Improvements

- Chat: shell command output is expanded by default, and adding a message to context puts focus back in the composer (thanks to @pascalandr, @makeittech).
- Chat: the composer caret is easier to see.
- Notebooks: notebook links open in the notebook editor when a compatible extension is installed (thanks to @TTTPOB).
- UI: dialogs, dropdowns, popovers and tooltips share the same glass styling.

### Fixes

- **Settings:** OpenCode configuration changes gather behind a single Apply & Restart action, so OpenCode no longer restarts after every edit. The confirmation warns you when active chats will be stopped (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: a queued message no longer sends into a response that is still streaming, and tool cards left running by an interrupted response settle instead of staying stuck (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: a message you submitted before switching sessions stays with the session and workspace you sent it from. If you switch away it is cancelled, never delivered to another runtime (thanks to @Wsyjq).
- Chat: a fresh message no longer replays its entry animation after it has been shown (thanks to @makeittech).
- MCP: authorization handles browser callbacks more reliably, settings show clearly which servers are available, and a failed connection offers a retry action.
- Settings: quick edits to notification templates no longer overwrite one another, and the collapsed-user-message preference sticks (thanks to @AmanTahiliani, @pascalandr).
- Attachments: removing an attached Office or OpenDocument file also removes the images taken out of that document (thanks to @chiamsun).
- Security: archive extraction updated for GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85 (thanks to @mel0nyrame).

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-04

### New

- **Sessions:** an archived session can be restored to the active list, from the sidebar context menu, the archived-sessions page or the bulk-selection bar (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: Ctrl/Cmd+L adds the selected text to the chat input, or focuses the input when nothing is selected.

### Improvements

- Providers: an OAuth-only provider shows a Connect flow in place of the API key form, and its models appear once you are signed in.
- Providers: a sign-in that needs extra details, such as GitHub Copilot Enterprise, asks for them before it opens the browser.

### Fixes

- **Providers:** signing in to an OAuth-only provider, such as Cursor, completes in the browser. The login is stored and the provider updates, so you are no longer left signed out.
- Providers: the copy button for device codes works.
- Chat: a model you chose by hand stays selected after a delegated subtask finishes; it no longer reverts to the agent's default model.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-04

### New

- **Providers:** add and edit custom OpenAI-compatible providers in Settings, with their endpoint, models, credentials, headers, and configuration scope (thanks to @makeittech).
- Localization: the interface is available in German (thanks to @SGD-DEV).
- Settings/Skills: skills kept in the workspace's own `.agents/skills` folder show up for the active workspace (thanks to @makeittech).
- Usage: DeepSeek quota is tracked (thanks to @airtaxi).

### Fixes

- Chat/Tools: Bash output reads as it did in the terminal instead of showing raw escape codes for progress bars and rewritten lines (thanks to @catan271).
- Chat: queued messages retry after a failed send or an interrupted turn instead of sitting stuck until the next session update.
- Chat: assistant messages no longer run HTML.
- Chat: clicking an apply_patch result opens the file you clicked instead of always the first one (thanks to @nabsiddiqui).
- Settings/Skills: renaming a skill keeps its instructions and supporting files. The rename action only shows for skills OpenChamber can safely move (thanks to @makeittech).
- Usage: Kimi for Coding counts usage correctly whether the provider reports what you used or what is left (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sessions: archiving and unarchiving stays inside the current workspace.
- Sidebar: a worktree shared by two projects appears once.
- Sidebar: session titles no longer clip at the ends of their rows.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-08-01

### Improvements

- Chat: a tool description shows the glob pattern when the tool was given one.
- Sessions: a session with an agent working shows a live activity dot even while the sidebar is collapsed (thanks to @pascalandr).

### Fixes

- Permissions: per-session auto-accept answers permission requests as they arrive when it is turned on.
- Chat: messages that arrive right after the connection opens no longer disappear.
- Chat: clicking the padding around the composer puts the cursor in the text (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat: the `/` menu lists a skill once when a command shares its name (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Usage: every Z.ai usage window shows up in the usage view.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-07-29

### New

- **OpenCode updates:** the extension can update a managed OpenCode installation and restart it for you. A server you manage yourself is left alone (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).

### Improvements

- **Chat tools:** a Bash card shows output while the command is still running, in a pane of fixed height that follows new lines until you scroll away. The timer keeps counting to the real end instead of stopping at 300 seconds.
- Chat: a slash-command starter picks up whatever you already typed in the draft and passes it as the command's arguments.
- Usage: an OpenAI business account shows the spend limit you configured for Codex (thanks to @jrandiny).

### Fixes

- Chat: a stalled response reconnects instead of hanging in the extension.
- Chat: a history you loaded to the end stops offering "Load older" after a refresh.
- Chat: messages you removed by reverting stay gone after you send the next message.
- Settings: subpanels keep a visible vertical scrollbar and lose the horizontal one (thanks to @sergiofspedro).

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-28

### New

- **Context panel:** Changes, pull requests, files, terminal, notes, plans, previews, and side chats live in one resizable panel with a rail to switch between them. The pull-request view shows checks and comments as they land, and a failed check or a comment can go straight into a chat draft.
- Chat: text selected from a Markdown code block keeps its fences, language, and block structure when you add it to the composer or start a session with it (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Settings: an option hides starter suggestions on the new-session screen.
- Usage: Crof and NeuralWatt quotas are tracked (thanks to @kydorn).

### Improvements

- **Chat composer:** what you type renders as you type it, with Markdown emphasis, attention lines, file and agent mentions, slash commands, snippets, attachment citations, and `~path` references. A file mention can be edited in place.
- Sessions: the sidebar uses clearer project zones and single-line rows, with folders after ungrouped sessions and archived sessions kept in their workspace sections.
- Chat/Permissions: sending a message while a permission prompt is open denies what is pending in the session and its subagents, then queues your message for the next turn (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat/Subagents: a subagent chat can be prompted while direct subagent prompting is on, even before the parent session has loaded.

### Fixes

- Sessions: chats sort by activity again. A chat moves in the list when it starts or finishes, and stops reshuffling while a response streams.
- Chat: jumping to a message in a long conversation lands on the right one even when the rows above it have not been drawn yet.
- Chat: code blocks stop shifting lines and merging into nearby text while they render, and copied code keeps its original text (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Usage: Crof no longer reports "Unsupported provider" (thanks to @kydorn).
- Shortcuts: double-Escape can no longer be primed while the current session is not the active one.

## [1.16.3] - 2026-07-22

### New

- **Chat attachments:** attach Office and OpenDocument files (`.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.odt`, `.odp`, `.ods`). Their text and the embedded images OpenChamber can read are pulled out before the message goes off.
- Chat attachments: more source-code formats, notebooks, HAR files with credentials and cookies stripped, SVG and Draw.io drawings, and HEIC/HEIF images. The composer warns you when the chosen model may ignore an attachment type.

### Improvements

- **Performance:** opening and switching sessions in a big workspace puts the selected and visible chats first.
- Chat: an assistant turn shows model, agent, thinking level, duration, and time together in its footer, and replies split by a hidden system or subagent prompt read as one turn.
- Sessions: workspace groups are ordered by hand by default. A sorting choice you made yourself stays as it is.

### Fixes

- Performance: a failed refresh keeps the session list you had, a parent session no longer vanishes when its sub-sessions load first, and session data stays inside its own workspace and view.
- Chat: the working indicator names the model actually writing the reply, streaming at the bottom no longer jitters, and a new user message finishes its entry animation instead of snapping into place.
- Chat/Tools: attachments returned by plugin and custom tools stay visible after streaming and refreshes, with the same image previews and file chips as your own attachments (thanks to @FrostiDrinks).
- Cursor: opening a chat no longer crashes when the editor webview lacks its usual messaging APIs, and a closed editor tab stops receiving late streaming messages (thanks to @makeittech).
- Startup: the active workspace is worked out before saved state is restored, so a project outside the editor workspace cannot replace it.
- Agent Manager: creating a worktree recovers when an earlier Git operation left the repository locked, and removing a worktree while its setup is still running no longer brings it back.

## [1.16.2] - 2026-07-18

### New

- Sessions: a new draft or session stays with the workspace selected in the sidebar, including multi-root and nested workspaces (thanks to @bashrusakh).

### Improvements

- **Settings:** every page uses the same responsive layout, navigation is grouped by area, and a save failure is shown in the page header.
- Settings: agent tool permissions separate inherited rules from explicit ones and list session-granted rules on their own (thanks to @makeittech).

### Fixes

- Permissions: per-session auto-accept works again, survives an extension restart, and covers subagent sessions while an OpenChamber view is open.
- Chat: when creating a session fails, the new-session draft stays open with the prompt you submitted.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-14

### Improvements

- Chat: a shell-mode command card updates its status and output while the command runs, and highlights the command and its output.

### Fixes

- **Performance:** a large workspace session list no longer regroups every session while chats stream.
- Chat: opening a long chat after an empty or aborted agent turn no longer reloads bigger and bigger parts of its history.
- Chat: a task card follows its own subagent when several run at once, so its activity and "Open subtask" no longer point at another session.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-13

### New

- Settings: an editor font size setting for the code editor (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Usage: OpenCode Go usage is tracked.

### Improvements

- Chat: a session with an active [goal](https://docs.openchamber.dev/session-goals/), started from the web or desktop app, shows the goal strip and its live status above the composer.
- Notifications: subagent completion notifications follow the same settings as the main app.

### Fixes

- Chat: code blocks are highlighted again. The webview's security policy was blocking the syntax highlighter (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: a queued message sends when the session is already idle instead of waiting forever (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: a pending agent question stays answerable after a restart, and a renamed session keeps its new title (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: tool output renders for tools that return something other than text (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sessions: pinned sessions survive a refresh (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Agents: saving agent settings from the UI keeps custom YAML frontmatter fields (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Windows: a difference in drive letter casing no longer splits one project into duplicates (thanks to @bashrusakh).

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-10

### New

- Chat/Tools: every tool call expands to show its input, result, and errors, including MCP, plugin, and custom tools. Read and Skill stay compact links to their files.
- Chat/Tools: a JSON result opens in navigable summary, tree, and raw views.
- Chat: code blocks can show line numbers that stay aligned while text streams in.
- Chat: a Wrap Code Block Lines setting controls how long lines wrap.
- Editor Integration: "Add to Context" and the active-editor pin selection use workspace-relative filenames, so the model reads the right file when two files share a name (thanks to @Catan).

### Improvements

- Chat: Mermaid diagrams have zoom controls (thanks to @c-w-xiaohei).
- Chat/Tools: an expanded file-edit or patch result has a button per file to open the diff or jump to the first changed line in the editor.

### Fixes

- Chat/Thinking: reasoning parts stay separate and in the order they happened, and a collapsed preview no longer ends with empty HTML comments.
- Chat: with Sticky User Header on, a user message no longer floats over earlier messages in a long conversation.
- Chat: a message that timed out or lost the connection after OpenCode accepted it stays in the conversation instead of being marked failed.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-07

### New

- Chat: the timeline dialog loads older messages when the session history is not fully fetched yet.

### Improvements

- Chat: file references with a line range like `src/file.ts:10-20` are clickable (thanks to @Catan).

### Fixes

- Chat: favorite models stay saved after the extension restarts (thanks to @Catan).
- Settings: closing Settings returns to the view you came from (thanks to @Catan).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-05

### Improvements

- Chat: loading older messages keeps your scroll position steady.

### Fixes

- Chat: the stop button aborts a session running in a different project or worktree. Those aborts used to do nothing at all.
- Startup: on Windows, OpenCode installed via npm launches from paths with spaces such as C:\Program Files\nodejs, a binary path pasted with quotes into the Opencode Binary setting works, and the extension also looks in the system-wide npm prefix and Scoop's shims.

## [1.13.9] - 2026-07-02

### Fixes

- Agents: clearing an optional agent field removes it from the agent config, where it used to save a `null`.
- Startup: the extension looks past OpenCode desktop app installs when it hunts for the standalone OpenCode CLI.
- Chat: late-loading tool content, subagent content and streaming Thinking blocks no longer pull the conversation away from the latest message or fight your scrolling.
- Chat: an embedded JSON example in a message stays text and no longer renders as a generated-result card.
- Sync: a chat wakes up properly after an idle reconnect, instead of leaving sessions stuck as busy.

## [1.13.8] - 2026-06-29

### New

- **Chat: choose what Enter does mid-reply.** A Follow-up behavior setting either steers your message into the agent's current turn or queues it until the turn finishes. It takes over from the old queue-mode toggle (thanks to @bashrusakh).

### Fixes

- Sync: a connected but quiet session, say an agent running a long tool call, stops kicking off a background refresh every 15 seconds (thanks to @tomzx).

## [1.13.7] - 2026-06-28

### Fixes

- Providers: the Add provider form stays open while provider data refreshes or you pick a model in the background. It used to snap back to an existing provider.
- Chat: with tool calls such as Bash and Edit expanded by default, scrolling no longer twitches, and slow scrolling no longer jumps past several messages.

## [1.13.6] - 2026-06-28

### Improvements

- Chat: scrolling stays steady while you send, queue, stream, switch sessions, and load older messages.

## [1.13.5] - 2026-06-27

### Misc

- No notable changes.

## [1.13.4] - 2026-06-27

### New

- Japanese: the interface is available in Japanese (thanks to @yuchi0531).
- Chat: drag a queued message to move it up or down the queue (thanks to @makeittech).

### Improvements

- Models: the model picker keeps your provider groups open and in the order you put them, and Shift+Delete drops a model from recents (thanks to @makeittech).

### Fixes

- Chat: sending a message closes an open question, so the composer no longer keeps the answered prompt on screen (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat: a conversation pinned to the bottom stays still after you send, and opening an older session lands on the latest message right away.
- Agents: editing an agent on an external OpenCode server no longer says it saved when it did not (thanks to @makeittech).
- Providers: the add-provider form keeps the provider you picked (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).

## [1.13.3] - 2026-06-24

### New

- Agents: agent settings have thinking variant, temperature, and top-p controls (thanks to @bashrusakh).

### Improvements

- Agents: clearing temperature or top-p removes the override (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Settings: your font size and padding apply inside the extension (thanks to @Sin991114).

### Fixes

- Chat: picking one of your own skills from the slash menu runs the skill instead of typing its name into the message (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat: a code block in your own message keeps characters like `<` and `->` (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: Arrow Up opens prompt history again when the cursor sits at the start of the composer.
- Chat: pasting text with an `@` in it no longer pops up file mentions (thanks to @charpeni).
- Chat: switching sessions or loading older messages no longer jumps the conversation backward or makes it wobble (thanks to @herjarsa).
- Sessions: a new session stays with the folder you picked (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sessions: pinned sessions and folders stay in the sidebar when a session list comes back empty (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Settings/Models: per-model visibility and sibling model choices stay saved (thanks to @attilaszasz).
- Settings/Skills: the skills catalog reloads after you change catalog settings (thanks to @gokulkgm).
- Usage: MiniMax M3 and Token Plan usage read the provider's current responses again (thanks to @baruchvitorino).
- Startup: managed OpenCode processes left over from a crash are cleaned up on the next start.

## [1.13.2] - 2026-06-18

### Improvements

- **Chat:** long conversations and big session lists stay smooth while a reply streams in (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Startup: the extension starts faster, it no longer waits for the default OpenCode config.

### Fixes

- Chat: the last words of a streamed reply are no longer cut off (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat: paragraphs in a reply have space between them again (thanks to @foundryseven).
- Startup: your manual and per-folder model choices survive a restart.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-06-17

### Improvements

- Chat: pinned welcome starters are on screen as soon as a new draft session opens.
- Chat: the context usage indicator is a round progress ring.
- Startup: providers and agents load faster.

### Fixes

- Chat: a reply full of code no longer freezes the page while it highlights.
- Chat: an amount like `$50` stays an amount instead of being read as math.
- Agents: deleting a built-in agent leaves it in place instead of quietly disabling it.
- Agents: deleting an agent whose definition is missing shows an error instead of doing nothing.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-15

### New

- Sessions: session rows now use a cleaner single-line layout, and a new control next to "archive all" toggles archived sessions on or off.

### Improvements

- Sessions: the list now groups sessions under their workspace, so pinning sessions and moving them into folders work as expected.
- Chat: custom-answer question textareas resize more steadily while typing (thanks to @bigcoder84).
- Chat/Performance: long conversations now use virtualized rendering to keep large histories responsive.
- Chat/Input: Arrow Up moves the cursor inside multi-line drafts again instead of always opening prompt history.
- Sessions: session menus now include a delete action (thanks to @ShogunPanda).
- Settings/MCP: importing MCP snippets from OpenCode config works again (thanks to @youzini).

### Fixes

- Startup: the extension opens faster — recent sessions, models, providers, and projects appear instantly from cache and refresh in the background, and the loading screen no longer lingers after the interface is ready.
- Startup: requests made while OpenCode is still starting now wait briefly for it to become ready instead of failing, and if OpenCode fails to start the error now includes what it reported.
- Chat/Input: tab-completing a mention no longer changes the selected agent (thanks to @Quat3rnion).

### Fixes

- Chat: completed responses no longer lose late-arriving summaries, token counts, errors, structured output, or changed-file details.
- Chat: question cards now show an error or no-longer-pending message when submit or dismiss fails instead of silently doing nothing.
- Chat: the first prompt in a new session no longer gets stuck before sending.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-03

### New

- Settings/Skills: installed skills are discovered more accurately, skill files opened from tool messages now load correctly, and snippet names keep their canonical casing (thanks to @jkker, @isanchez404).

### Fixes

- Chat/UI: chats keep following the latest response after final task summaries, activity reasoning no longer flashes before settling, and assistant timestamps stay visible on narrow layouts.

## [1.11.4] - 2026-05-22

### New

- Sessions: opening a session now fetches a smaller initial message page, while still expanding enough to show the latest user turn when needed.
