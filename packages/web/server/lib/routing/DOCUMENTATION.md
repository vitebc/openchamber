# Routing

## Purpose

Jev model routing, the permission safety net, and the classification provider
that answers both. With the `openchamber/auto` model selected, the server asks
[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) (TypeSafe's System One decision model) which
task category a message belongs to and sends it with that category's model,
thinking variant and agent. In a session whose permission mode is `safety`
(`../permission-auto-accept/DOCUMENTATION.md`), the same kind of call decides
whether a permission is accepted or stays on screen for the user.

Routing needs the OpenChamber server, so it is present wherever that server is
and absent everywhere else: VS Code talks to OpenCode directly and never offers
Auto. There is no env gate — the feature shipped dark behind
`OPENCHAMBER_ROUTING_ENABLE` until Jev stopped needing a key of the user's own
(see "Where a Jev request goes"), which was the reason to hide it.

## Files

- `defaults.js` — the Auto sentinel, the Jev endpoints and models, the
  `ZEN_JEV_PROMOTION_ACTIVE` switch, built-in categories, the question wording
  for routing and for the safety net, history excerpt limits.
- `classifier.js` — the classification providers: `resolveClassifier` (the
  user's pick, what is usable, and the source that actually answers) and
  `classifierEndpoint` (where a request for a source goes), and
  `legacyClassifier` (the view older clients parse).
- `store.js` — `routing.json` (only deviations from the built-ins),
  `routing-auth.json` (the TypeSafe key alone, mode 0600) and
  `classification.json` (the classification provider pick) in the OpenChamber
  data dir. An unreadable pick file reads as no pick. `resolveEffectiveConfig` merges built-ins with stored overrides;
  `toStoredConfig` is its inverse. A missing file is the defaults, a malformed
  one throws.
- `jev.js` — request builders, answer parsing, and the HTTP call with a
  timeout to the endpoint `classifierEndpoint` chose.
- `history.js` — the last three settled turns through session assist's
  `loadAssistContext` (text parts only, attached quotes included, no files or
  tool payloads), each user message cut to its head and each answer to head
  plus tail. The new request is never cut.
- `runtime.js` — `createRoutingRuntime`: `describe`, `classifierEndpoint` (the
  endpoint a Jev request goes to now, or null; also used by
  `../session-work`), `noteModelSelection`,
  `isAutoSession`, `resolveAutoSelection`, `applySessionSelection`, `routeSend`,
  `evaluatePermission`, `legacySafetyNetEnabled`, config, token and classifier
  writes, event broadcasts.
- `routes.js` — `/api/routing` (GET, PUT), `/api/routing/token` (PUT, DELETE),
  `/api/routing/classifier` (PUT) and `registerRoutingPromptRewrite`.

## Invariants

- The sentinel never reaches OpenCode. OpenCode 2.x holds the model and agent
  on the session and a prompt body carries only the user's text, so Auto is
  per-session state: `POST /api/session` drops the sentinel from the create
  body (the session starts on OpenCode's default; the first send switches it),
  `POST /api/session/:id/model` with the sentinel is
  swallowed and marks the session (`noteModelSelection`), and every
  `POST /api/session/:id/{prompt,command}` in a marked session is routed
  (`routeSend`) and switches the session onto the answer before the send is
  forwarded. Both sit ahead of the generic proxy, which replays a parsed body.
  The message queue calls `resolveAutoSelection` itself and applies the answer
  with the model/agent switches it already makes. Without a fallback model the
  runtime throws 400 rather than forwarding. The OpenChamber session service
  (`openchamber-sessions/routes.js`) talks to OpenCode through the SDK and can
  pick Auto up from Session Defaults, so it calls `resolveAutoSelection` itself
  before switching the session.
- The mark lives in process memory. A server restart between the model switch
  and the next send drops it (see the TODO in `runtime.js`).
- Routing failures keep the user's own behaviour: a Jev error, timeout, unknown
  category or low confidence routes to the fallback model, and the decision
  carries the reason.
- The safety net accepts only on a verdict from Jev. With no usable
  classification provider it holds quietly (the session behaves like `ask`);
  when Jev fails it holds, broadcasts `openchamber:routing.safety-skipped` with
  the error, and does not remember the failure, so reconnect reconciliation asks
  again. It runs whether or not Auto routing is enabled: the routing config's
  `safetyNet.enabled` is no longer read except once, by
  `legacySafetyNetEnabled`, when the permission policy converts pre-modes
  entries. `safetyNet.threshold` still applies.
- A category without a model uses the fallback model *and* variant; a variant
  only travels with the model it was chosen for. A category agent replaces the
  composer's agent; an empty one keeps it.
- Auto is offered (`autoReady`) with a usable classification provider
  (`jevAvailable`), `enabled`, a fallback model and at least two enabled
  categories.
- Held permission decisions are cached for 15 minutes per request id so
  reconnect reconciliation in `permission-auto-accept` does not re-ask Jev;
  `permission.replied` forgets them.
- The send rewrite reads a body only in a session already marked as routed,
  which the URL alone answers; every other send, and anything that is not JSON,
  reaches the proxy as the stream it arrived as.

## Where a Jev request goes

The user picks a classification provider in Settings → Providers →
Classification providers:

- `zen-promo`: `opencode.ai/zen/v1/systemone` as `jev-1.13-free`, which OpenCode
  Zen answers with no credential at all. Usable while
  `ZEN_JEV_PROMOTION_ACTIVE` is true; flip it when OpenCode ends the promotion.
- `zen-key`: the same endpoint as `jev-1.13` with a Zen API key read from
  OpenCode's credentials (`opencode/auth.js`, entry `opencode`, type `api`).
  An OpenCode account sign-in is an OAuth credential, and zen rejects it as a
  key ("Invalid API key", checked 2026-09-27), so it does not count. The paid
  call itself is not verified live yet.
- `openrouter`: `openrouter.ai/api/v1/systemone` as `jev-latest` (OpenRouter's
  `~typesafe/jev-latest` alias) with the OpenRouter API key saved in OpenCode
  (entry `openrouter`, type `api`), billed to that OpenRouter account.
- `vercel`: `ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe/v1/systemone` as `typesafe-ai/jev`
  with the Vercel AI Gateway API key saved in OpenCode (entry `vercel`, type
  `api`). Both gateways implement TypeSafe's request and response shapes, so
  `jev.js` is the same for every source. Both answer 401 without a key
  (checked 2026-09-27); a paid call is not verified live yet.
- `typesafe`: `api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` as `jev-latest` with the key saved
  in `routing-auth.json`. Saving a key also picks it.

Without a stored pick the default is `typesafe` when a key is saved (it always
won before the pick existed) and `zen-promo` otherwise. A pick that cannot be
used falls back to the first usable source, own keys first (`typesafe`,
`openrouter`, `vercel`, `zen-key`, `zen-promo`); none usable means no Jev.
The OpenCode keys are read on every request, so a key added or removed in
OpenCode counts from the next request on.

OpenRouter and Vercel also count a key in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` /
`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (`readOpenCodeKeys`), because OpenCode connects those
providers from the variable live and never stores it (v2 `integration.ts`
`resolveConnections`). A key saved in OpenCode wins. The server's
`process.env` already carries the login-shell snapshot and a managed OpenCode
is spawned from it, so both see the same variable; an external OpenCode
started elsewhere may not, and then the variable simply is not seen. Zen has
no variable.

Every zen call is tagged `x-opencode-client: openchamber`. Dax approved the
free use in Slack on 2026-09-22 on terms the code and the copy keep together:
zen can identify and throttle our calls through that header, and the
Classification providers page tells the user in plain words that the free model
is a limited-time OpenCode promotion. Zen rejects the `jev-latest` alias, so
versioned ids are sent.

Never make the free tier the only path: the zen docs call it "available for a
limited time", and the keys are what users fall back to when it ends.

## Events

Broadcast on the OpenChamber control stream: `openchamber:routing.updated`
(availability, including `jevAvailable`), `openchamber:routing.decision` (per
send), `openchamber:routing.permission-held`,
`openchamber:routing.safety-skipped`. The last two carry the request's
directory so the UI can raise the permission toast for a held request.

`/api/routing` keeps `jevSource` (`typesafe` or `zen-free`) for clients from
before the classifier pick and adds `jevAvailable`, `classifier` and
`classification` (both `selected`, `effective`, `sources`). `classification`
is the full picture. `classifier` is what v2.0.2 clients parse: their schema
knows only `zen-promo`, `zen-key` and `typesafe` and rejects the whole state
on any other id, so it lists only those and is null while OpenRouter or
Vercel is picked or answering (`legacyClassifier`). Current clients read
`classification` and drop source ids they do not know.

## UI

`packages/ui/src/stores/useRoutingStore.ts` projects `/api/routing` and these
events (`selectSafetyNetAvailable` gates the safety-net mode everywhere);
`hooks/useRoutingSync.ts` keeps it current, shows the skipped-check toast and
raises the permission toast for a held request (`notifyHeldPermission`). `lib/routing/autoModel.ts` owns the sentinel; `useConfigStore` accepts it
as a valid selection while `autoReady`. `ModelPickerList` renders it as the
pinned `leadingEntry`; `ModelControls` hides the agent and thinking controls
while Auto is selected. `PermissionCard` shows the hold reason. Settings →
Routing (`components/sections/routing/RoutingPage.tsx`) edits the config with
debounced saves. Settings → Providers → Classification providers
(`components/sections/classification/ClassificationProvidersPage.tsx`) picks
the source and manages the TypeSafe key; `JevAccessNote` links there from the
features that need Jev.

## Tests

`store.test.js` (defaults, deviation round-trip, deleted built-ins, malformed
file, token file mode, classifier pick), `runtime.test.js` (request text,
excerpts, decisions, endpoints, classifier fallback, rewrite and fallback
paths, safety net accept/hold/skip/unavailable), `routes.http.test.js`
(sentinel dropped from a create and swallowed on the model switch, routed send
ahead of a stand-in proxy, the routes). The queue and auto-accept tests cover
their hooks.
