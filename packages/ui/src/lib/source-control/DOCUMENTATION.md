# UI source control

## Repository binding authority

`repository-binding.ts` owns binding reads and their lifecycle for the shared UI.
Editors, GitView, PullRequestSection, walkthrough, sidebar discovery and provider
pickers use this owner. MobileChangesSurface mounts the same binding settings;
it does not keep another binding snapshot. Network operation planning still
performs its own fresh safety reads through RuntimeAPIs, outside this UI owner.

- Demand is keyed by runtime identity and exact directory. Only an authoritative
  repository ID joins worktree scopes. Equal paths on different runtimes never
  share state.
- `idle`, `loading`, `ready`, `stale` and `error` distinguish an unresolved read, an actual
  request, successful empty binding and failure. Refresh failure retains the last
  complete `read` as stale, along with the original Error and its metadata.
- `contexts` grants provider-read demand only while the owner read is ready and
  the selected association's readiness is `ready` with a matching approved fetch
  fingerprint. Aggregate `needs-attention` does not suppress healthy siblings.
  Consumers also check the existing exact-account auth selector. Retained
  binding or account metadata does not authorize provider requests or stale
  provider results after authority is lost.
  Pending picker reads check the captured hook's `isCurrent` before publishing,
  so binding or runtime invalidation rejects completions before React cleanup.
- PR-status arbitration owns status demand only. It cannot accept, reject or
  suppress the binding snapshot used by an editor.
- PR, walkthrough and branch-diff surfaces take provider identity and the primary
  remote from the first ready committed binding context. Repository default
  branches and remote-qualified base hints are accepted only from that remote;
  another configured remote is not reinterpreted through the selected binding.
  Provider capability loading or failure grants no create or merge support.
  Failure remains distinct from an authoritative unsupported result and requires
  an explicit Retry.
- Concurrent reads of a directory share one promise. Mounted consumers subscribe
  to that directory, not a global collection. There is no binding polling timer.
  Retry is explicit; a failed read does not restart itself on render or remount.
  Releasing the last subscriber marks complete data stale; new demand refreshes
  it without discarding the previous snapshot.
- Provider and transport editors capture a mutation scope before sending the
  existing API intent. It includes runtime generation, directory, expected
  repository ID and expected revision. `setMutationResult` rejects mismatched
  repositories and non-advancing or obsolete results, then publishes accepted
  results to all known scopes for that repository. Call `release` in `finally`.
- Reads return committed state, including newer mutation results. A worktree's
  first in-flight read also overlays a newer result already known for its
  repository. Conflict reconciliation waits for older reads, then starts one
  shared fresh read. It never retries a write. A successful reconciliation updates
  all known aliases, including mounted PR and picker consumers.
- Subscribers, pending reads and pending mutations pin their entries. Rendering
  only reads snapshots and never creates or evicts entries. One deferred cleanup
  pass retains at most 64 idle directory entries; live entries may exceed that
  soft limit. Repository indexes disappear with their last directory entry.
- `runtimeEndpointReset.ts` resets the owner before the new runtime is used.
  Generations reject late reads and mutation results even when a later switch
  returns to the same runtime key. No binding data is persisted.

The owner consumes the existing `SourceControlAPI.repositoryBinding`, provider
mutation and confirmed reset, plus `GitAPI.configureTransportBinding`,
`GitAPI.removeTransportBinding`, and `GitAPI.configureAuxiliaryBinding` results. Web, Electron, VS Code,
hosted mobile and Capacitor keep their existing adapters and unsupported/error
behavior. UI sharing does not replace server authorization or CAS enforcement.

Shared account removal requires an exact credential account ID; the web adapter
rejects omitted or padded IDs before transport. Provider mutation receipts expose the
server-derived provider-user identity as `actor.providerAccountId`; request
contexts continue to carry only exact credential and binding authority.

The [binding contract](../../../../web/server/lib/source-control/DOCUMENTATION.md)
defines capability readiness and the strict persisted store contract. `boundGitNetworkOperation`
checks the selected remote's readiness and exact saved fetch/push fingerprints,
not aggregate binding state. Requests carry the current repository config revision;
the binding retains its approved endpoints for independent repair. Provider contexts
and cache keys retain the single overall CAS revision, so stale contexts require a
fresh owner read even when another capability caused the revision change.

## Anonymous transport

Anonymous HTTPS is a transport an identity may carry; identity pickers label it read-only in every locale, without a repeated confirmation modal, and disable it for SSH remotes. A clone URL change re-proposes the identity for the new host. Publish destinations label and disable anonymous grants, and shared request builders reject anonymous push, sync publication and remote deletion before calling the planner. Shared binding and network parsers retain the anonymous tag, never a verified actor or System marker. The connected OpenChamber server remains the authorization owner; clone still reports retained-checkout binding failure as finish-setup rather than success.

## Managed SSH onboarding

`ManagedSshCredentials.tsx` is the key picker inside the identity editor — the one place a managed SSH key is chosen — through the optional `GitAPI.managedSshCredentials` operation. It starts no inventory, discovery, import, or provider authentication on mount. Explicit inventory returns safe labels, public fingerprints and opaque managed references. Explicit discovery returns short-lived opaque candidates from the connected server. Ready candidates show their exact fingerprint, require a keyboard/touch-capable confirmation checkbox, and keep Import disabled until confirmation. Import selects the returned managed credential in the current local draft when a selector is present, but never saves a repository grant, binds a provider, or changes author identity. Transport Save or clone execution remains the separate authorization action.

Reads distinguish failure from empty success. Failed operations retain data but disable stale inventory selection; explicit buttons remain available for retry. Typed expiry, source-change, mismatch, unavailable, and capacity rejections tell the user to rediscover or repair host state. Runtime-will-change and unmount invalidate pending inventory, discovery, and import results. Runtime changes clear candidates, confirmation, and selection without loading the new host automatically.

The connected OpenChamber server owns discovery and imported copies for web, Electron and both mobile clients. The UI explains that discovery is limited to immediate private-key files in the server user's approved `~/.ssh`, with no recursion, symlink, SSH config, or agent inspection. It points passphrase-protected and agent-only users to explicit unverified System transport. VS Code omits the server inventory capability; its transport is always the user's system Git. All onboarding and error copy is translated in all 11 locales. The [Git module](../../../../web/server/lib/git/DOCUMENTATION.md#exact-ref-transport-authority) owns candidate lifetime, verification, storage, protocol enforcement, rollback, and provisioning constraints.

## Repository identity

One repository works as one identity. `applyIdentity.ts` turns a chosen
`GitIdentityProfile` into the committed state: it adds, replaces, or removes the
provider association through the exact-target mutation, writes the primary
remote's transport grant from the identity's transport (`account`, `ssh`,
`system`, or `anonymous`), and applies the author with
`setGitIdentity(directory, profileId)`. A repository with no remote, and a
runtime that holds no bindings (VS Code), receive the signature alone. The `global` profile is the System
identity — it removes the provider association and clears the repository-local
author so the person's own Git configuration answers, and OpenChamber never
writes the machine's own (global or system) configuration. No choice asks for
confirmation, System included: a repository with no binding already uses this
machine's Git exactly as before. Account and SSH-key identities do write into
the repository's own `.git/config` (the credential helper and
`core.sshCommand`, see the server's git module doc); choosing System or
unbinding removes those entries.

`identityApplicability` keeps identities specific to an instance and a scheme:
an account identity whose instance host differs from the remote host, an
account or anonymous identity on a non-HTTPS remote, or an SSH-key identity on a
non-SSH remote is disabled with a localized reason (`describeIdentityApplicability`)
and never proposed. `proposeIdentityForHost` proposes, among applicable identities,
the one whose account answers for the remote host, then the default identity,
then the System identity — the repository as it is. The add screen shows the
repository as it is signed today, its own local author included, and writes
nothing unless the person picked an identity themselves: adding a directory
never rewrites an author or binds an account on its own.

Applying an identity grants its own remote; every other remote follows it
through a grant the server derives on each read and transfer (`inherited: true`
on the binding read, never persisted): all of them for the System identity,
those on the identity's host and protocol for any other, so a fork answers
beside its upstream without being named twice and a remote added later is
covered too. Applying an identity removes grants an earlier identity saved on
other remotes so they follow the new one. An address the identity cannot
reach — another instance, a scheme its transport does not speak — keeps no
grant and is offered in the repository configuration with a choice of the
identities that can reach it; a remote's own grant wins over the derived one.
A new branch is pushed to the identity's remote unless someone picks another
in the publish dialog. System Git needs no
confirmation: it is what a repository uses until something else is chosen.
Git in a terminal or the agent's shell follows the same grants through the
repository's own `.git/config`, which the server writes; the UI records no
OpenCode restart for it. The same rule serves the add and clone screens
(`DirectoryExplorerDialog`), the Git panel (`IdentityDropdown` in `GitHeader`),
and the mobile Changes surface.

`getBoundSourceControlReadContexts` names the accounts a repository's change requests and issues are read with: its bound providers first, then the current account of any host its remotes point at (`useSourceControlAuthStore`), so an unbound repository on github.com keeps its PR chip and list. The binding owner asks the auth store for a host it has not read yet and republishes contexts when the accounts change.

`activeIdentityFor` decides which identity a repository is acting as, for the
panel and the mobile Changes surface alike: the repository's own author picks
it, a repository that names none is on the System identity, and an author no
identity carries is shown as itself. The Git panel button shows that identity's
icon and name, drawn from the committed binding read and the repository author,
never from an unsaved choice.
Managed HTTPS presentation comes only from the exact revision-pinned credential
projection in the binding read; account IDs, credential IDs, key paths and tokens
are never labels. Failed reads retain explicitly stale context, not an
authoritative empty binding. VS Code offers no identity switching; the webview
projects repository remotes as a ready System binding.

`RepositoryConfigurationDialog` in `SourceControlBindingSettings.tsx` is reached
from the identity menu and holds what an identity does not decide: the other
addresses it could not serve (`AdditionalRemoteGrants`) and checkout hydration
repair (`AuxiliaryBindingSettings` in `RepositoryBindingEditors.tsx`). There is no
separate reset: choosing the System identity removes the provider association,
the transport grant and the repository-local author. Its draft lifetime ends on
close or runtime/directory scope change; drafts and cancellation do not mutate,
and stale conflicts perform one fresh owner read without retrying the mutation.
Account and profile inventories remain in Git Settings.

`selectableIdentities` is the one place that decides what a repository may be
given: the System identity, always, plus stored identities that are complete.
The System identity is what OpenChamber read from the machine's own Git
configuration — it is stored nowhere, cannot be created or edited, and choosing
it means no override applies here, which is why the completeness rule does not
reach it. `identityDisplayName` names it from the product's own copy
(`gitView.identity.system`) rather than from the record, whose `name` carries
the discovered author as a fallback.

An identity is also not offered once the account it names is disconnected:
`identityAccountConnected` compares the identity's credential against the
accounts the auth store holds for that instance, and an instance that has not
been read yet answers "connected" rather than hiding everything. The identity
menu re-reads the accounts when it opens, the Git Settings row says why the
identity cannot be used, and nothing binds a repository to a credential that
is gone.

An identity is complete when it has a signature and a way to push:
`isCompleteIdentity` accepts `account` with an account, a managed SSH key,
anonymous HTTPS, or `system` (this machine's Git). The account is optional
except for the `account` transport, so identities for hosts OpenChamber has no
provider for (Bitbucket, Gitea, a private server) work. The editor creates
nothing else and the server refuses anything else from a client.

Records written before identities carried a transport have none; they read as
`system` identities: choosing one writes the repository's author and leaves
Git to this machine's configuration. Git Settings marks an identity it cannot
use (`incomplete`, `accountGone`) and says why.

Checkout repair first runs `checkout-hydration` against a user-selected ready parent fetch remote. The immutable public plan exposes bounded repository-relative submodule/LFS paths and redacted endpoints, never raw URLs, absolute paths, or credential references. Failed hydration stays visible through `GitOperationStatus`. The user selects one discovered endpoint, explicitly chooses System, anonymous HTTPS, managed HTTPS account, or managed SSH key, and saves or removes only that grant through the narrow CAS API. Retry plans a new inspection; it never reclones the retained repository. Missing `git-lfs` has a specific install-and-retry warning. Runtime and directory changes clear all repair drafts, and late mutation results reconcile through the captured binding owner scope.

## Unresolved Git operations

`git-operation-recovery.ts` owns the shared pending-operation guard. The bound
network helpers check writable storage and reserve the runtime/repository scope
before planning, persist the returned reference before execution, and check
durability again immediately before dispatch. A failed reference write may leave
an unexecuted server plan, but never starts its Git process. Planning itself does
not mutate the repository. No recovery path plans or executes an operation. This
includes checkout hydration: a restored reference is queried by ID and never
resumed automatically.

The versioned `sessionStorage` record contains at most 64 references. Each holds
the operation ID and kind, server runtime identity, repository ID, and SHA-256
digests of the client runtime key and immutable public target. New records also
hold a digest of the server's durable public target form. It contains no
endpoint URLs, directories, transport credentials or actors, output, error
messages, or result history. Clone uses a null repository ID, not a fabricated
repository or System transport. An unresolved clone conservatively blocks other
clones on that runtime; existing-repository guards use the real repository ID.
The second target digest uses the same public-safe form as durable server
recovery: it omits force-lease SHAs and strips SCP usernames while retaining
endpoint fingerprints, so a restarted operation still matches the marker that
guarded it. The original exact target digest remains authoritative while those
fields are present and keeps existing version-1 references readable.
For the same terminal-only recovery case, HTTP operation tracking accepts the
durable omission of a verified actor; runtime identity, operation ID, transport
mode and verification, endpoint fingerprints, refs, and all non-redacted target
fields must still match.
Anonymous clone/read transport and retained-checkout partial results keep their
existing contracts.

References survive panel unmount and page reload within the same browser tab.
New tabs and separate webview storage contexts are independent. Unavailable or
malformed session storage fails closed. Plain HTTP LAN clients do not need
SubtleCrypto: the recovery owner uses a local FIPS 180-4 SHA-256 fallback when
that API is absent. Native and fallback paths hash the same TextEncoder UTF-8
bytes and produce identical lowercase hex, so v1 references need no migration
and unknown markers remain matched rather than discarded.

These hashes are equality/storage-redaction fingerprints, not authentication,
encryption, a MAC, or tamper-proof storage. They keep literal runtime and Git URLs
out of the record; an unsalted hash does not promise secrecy against guessing.
Recovery independently compares the exact server runtime ID and platform,
repository ID, operation ID and kind, and immutable target fingerprint before
accepting GET or clearing a marker. Runtime adapters and the backend still own
authentication and authorization. The fallback is private to this owner and is
not used for credentials, pairing, signatures, or relay crypto. Existing cache
fingerprints use a different algorithm and cannot match persisted v1 hashes;
preserving SHA-256 avoids a dual-format migration that could strand old guards.

The owner never evicts unresolved references, including other runtimes' entries,
to make room. Capacity rejects new plans. Writes are synchronous, and removals
re-read storage after asynchronous target verification so an intervening write
cannot erase another operation.

`useGitOperationRecovery` resolves the current repository before matching saved
references. Hydration shows unavailable/reconciling state and blocks conflicting
actions. A saved marker is uncertainty, never evidence of a running process or
completed step. Only GET of the original ID can restore live status, with the
captured runtime identity and target checked before accepting it. Mount and
browser-online recovery coalesce overlapping reads; there is no polling timer.
Runtime changes reject late reconciliation and never send old IDs through the
new endpoint. Cancel requires a verified active snapshot on the captured scope.

Known terminal results remove the marker only after the removal is durable.
Removal failure leaves the blocker in place and exposes storage recovery.
`outcome-unknown`, failed reads, authentication failures, and `NOT_FOUND` after a
server restart retain the reference. The UI exposes the ID, Refresh, and external
repository/remote inspection guidance. It does not offer a forget-and-retry
waiver: nothing establishes an unknown transfer's outcome. Full terminal feedback and the local-commit notice remain
mounted-view state, not persisted history.

`git-operation-recovery.test.ts` covers storage failures, reload, capacity,
runtime isolation, unknown/missing outcomes, and anonymous clone references.
`useGitOperationRecovery.test.ts` covers actual React unmount/remount, read-only
hydration, scoped controls and durable guards. These tests do not prove behavior
after browser storage is explicitly cleared or a webview is replaced with a new
storage context.

## Tests

`repository-binding.test.ts` covers deferred failure, successful empty, concurrent
demand, mutation overlays, aliases, scope invalidation, conflict reconciliation
and retention. The 100-consumer regression permits one initial request and no
additional requests or notifications for 10,000 warm snapshot reads.
`applyIdentity.test.ts` covers the provider/transport/author writes an identity
produces, that grants an earlier identity saved on other remotes are removed so
they follow the new one, and instance and scheme applicability;
`identity.test.ts` covers remote traits and host proposal. Account cases in
`sourceControlOAuthPolling.test.tsx` cover localized retry and runtime switching.
These tests do not validate a packaged runtime, real credentials or browser paint.

`SourceControlBindingSettings.test.tsx` covers the repository dialog's all-locale copy.
