// Whether a message on a model may go to an isolated space, checked on "Send" before it leaves the
// composer: a message on a provider the space has no key for stays in the input with the reason
// instead of failing inside the space.
//
// A running space is judged by the journey list, which the host reads from the record and the
// gatekeeper, so the answer holds in every window and after a reload. Before a space runs, and
// while the creation in this window is still giving the access chosen in the dialog, only this
// window knows what the space will get: the providers chosen there, by the draft's waiting request
// and by the space's project directory. Without an answer from the host nothing is refused, and
// neither is a provider the grant dialog cannot give a key for, a browser login or OpenCode's own
// among them: the dialog would be a dead end, and such a model may work inside all the same.
// One exception: OpenCode's own provider reaches opencode.ai, which a space that allows only
// chosen addresses blocks unless that name is on its list, so the message would fail inside
// with a bare 403; it stays in the composer with the name to allow instead.
