# File tree loading and visibility

`FilesView` and `SidebarFilesTree` keep directory snapshots in component state.
`DirectoryRequests` owns shared in-flight reads and supersession. Repeated
same-path callers await the same request; an explicit mutation refresh can
replace it. Scope changes and unmount clear the coordinator, so old completions
cannot publish or remove a newer request's slot. Callers also check runtime
identity at completion.

Directory arrays retain their references when every rendered field and ordering
matches. `fileTreeStatus.ts` builds path and ancestor indexes once per Git
snapshot. Open-file membership has its own set, so changing tabs does not
rebuild the Git index.

Desktop `FilesView` in editor-only mode neither loads nor constructs its unused
tree. Mobile retains its tree. The context panel passes actual visibility,
including the panel's open state, its active tab, and the editor toggle, to each file surface.
Hidden surfaces retain drafts, loaded content and scroll state. They stop
directory and file metadata polling; reopening checks freshness once before
normal polling resumes. Autosave is independent of visibility.

Background polling never supersedes an in-flight directory read. Explicit
refresh after file mutations does. Each directory failure remains local and
preserves its previous successful snapshot.

Opening a file outside the workspace reads it directly through the active
runtime, in both editor-only and full Files modes. Chat navigation and file
loading do not request native file grants. Server-backed text reads and metadata
requests have a 30-second deadline, including response-body reads, so a stalled
request reaches the existing error handler instead of leaving loading pending.

Sidebar root/runtime changes remount the scoped tree. Its bounded module cache
provides continuity between mounts; request cancellation for collapsed paths
stops queued batches, while already-started reads may populate the same-scope
cache. Runtime changes and unmount invalidate those active reads.

Sidebar rows use browser `content-visibility: auto` to skip layout and paint for
offscreen row contents without unmounting them. The explicit row height follows
the meta line height, the icon minimum and vertical padding, so remembered
offscreen dimensions cannot retain an old font size. Expanded child lists
sit outside each row's containment, so expansion, scrolling, focus and menus keep
their existing DOM structure. Reopening still refreshes directory contents.

## Artifact previews

`previews/` holds what the viewer shows instead of text: `ImageArtifact`
(fit or 1:1, natural dimensions), `MediaArtifact` (native audio/video
element, duration and dimensions once metadata loads, a stated failure when
the runtime cannot decode the codec), `FontArtifact` (a specimen under a
throwaway `FontFace` family removed when the tab closes), `TableArtifact`
(CSV/TSV through `delimitedText.ts`, capped rows stated in the meta line),
and `BinaryArtifact` (name, type, size, download; never a decode attempt).
`FilesView.renderArtifactPreview` is the single switch both the docked and
the fullscreen viewer use. SVG, Mermaid (`.mmd`) and delimited files are text
with an artifact view: each has a per-path preview/source toggle, and opens
in preview regardless of the text-first setting because an agent-produced
artifact is opened to be looked at.

Non-text artifacts the browser must own (PDF, audio, video, fonts) are loaded
through `getRuntimeUrlResolver().authenticatedAsset('/api/fs/raw', …)` with
the scoped URL token; the server streams byte ranges so playback can seek.
Images keep the object-URL/data-URL path.

`useMarkdownLocalAssets` makes a rendered Markdown file's relative images and
links work: images are fetched through the runtime against the file's own
directory (outside the workspace when the file is) and swapped for object
URLs that are revoked with the preview; relative links open the target file
through `useUIStore.openContextFile`, which the context panel and the mobile
files surface both consume.

An agent can ask for a file to be shown (`file.open` on the managed
`openchamber` tool). The server broadcasts `openchamber:file-open-request`;
`ContextPanel` answers it with `openContextFile`, `MobileApp` additionally
opens the files drawer. VS Code has no shared file viewer and no managed
tool, so the event never reaches it.

## Uploads

`useFileTreeUpload` owns uploads for both trees: `FilesView` (including
mobile) and `SidebarFilesTree`. Files arrive through desktop drag-and-drop or
through the system picker, which folder menus ("Upload Files") and the tree
toolbar open. A single upload runs at a time, in batches of three. Existing
names are never replaced silently: they collect into a replace-confirmation
dialog, which is dropped when the workspace or runtime changes. The feature is
present only when the runtime exposes `files.uploadFile`.
