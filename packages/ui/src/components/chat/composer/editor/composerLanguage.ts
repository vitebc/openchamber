/**
 * The composer's prompt language as a CodeMirror extension.
 *
 * `tokenizeComposer` already answers "what does this text mean"; this module
 * is the thin adapter that turns its ranges into mark decorations and keeps
 * them in sync with the document and with the workspace registries.
 *
 * Why this replaces the mirror overlay: a transparent textarea painted over a
 * mirror div can only use styles that do not change glyph advance width, or
 * the two layers drift apart and the caret lands in the wrong place. That is
 * why bold and italic were never highlighted, and why the overlay had to be
 * switched off entirely on mobile. CodeMirror owns the caret and the text, so
 * there is no second layer to keep aligned and no metric restriction.
