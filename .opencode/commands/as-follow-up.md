description: Follow up on an anti-slop PR by addressing review feedback
agent: build
---

You are working in the OpenChamber repository.

Goal: follow up on an existing anti-slop maintenance PR, address Greptile/review bot feedback, and clean up the local batch handoff files when done.

This task can run unattended on a schedule, so it must be safe to start at any moment and must stop cleanly when there is nothing to do.

First, verify the worktree is safe to use:

`git status --porcelain`

If the output is not empty, decide which of two situations you are in.

If the repository root contains a `.maintenance-clone` marker file, this working copy is a disposable clone dedicated to unattended maintenance. Nothing in it is human work in progress, so leftover changes are debris from an earlier task that failed to clean up after itself. Recover the clone rather than stopping:

```
git checkout -- .
git clean -fd
git checkout main
git pull
```

Report exactly which files you discarded, then continue with the task. A failed predecessor must not be able to jam the pipeline for every later run.

If the marker file is absent, this is a working copy a person uses. Stop immediately and report that the worktree has uncommitted changes. Do not stash, reset, discard, commit, or switch branches.

List the active batches:

`bun run deslop -- active`

The listing may include batches owned by the React Doctor pipeline; those are shown as `[pipeline rd]`. Never touch them.

Workflow:
- If there are no active batches, stop and report that there is nothing to follow up.
- Each active batch corresponds to one open PR. Read its `batch.json` for `runId`, `branchName`, `batchName`, `prTitle`, and selected files.
- Use `gh` to find the open PR for each batch branch.
- Work on the oldest batch that has an open PR with unaddressed feedback. If several qualify, handle exactly one and leave the rest.
- If a batch's PR was already merged or closed, do not treat it as follow-up work. Release its claim with `bun run deslop -- release --run <run-id>` so its files return to the pool, then continue looking.
- If no batch has an open PR with actionable feedback, stop and report that.
- Switch to the batch branch using the exact `branchName`.
- Pull or update the branch from remote if needed.
- Use `gh` to inspect PR review comments, PR issue comments, review threads if available, and check run summaries if relevant.
- Focus specifically on Greptile/review bot feedback and actionable reviewer comments.
- Pay particular attention to comments questioning whether a type contract is now wrong, whether a `// SAFETY:` comment is accurate, or whether a call site was missed. These are the likely real defects in this kind of PR.
- Address actionable comments with minimal follow-up fixes.
- Keep changes within the original selected files whenever possible.
- If a review comment requires changes outside the selected files, make only the minimal required supporting change.
- Do not perform unrelated cleanup.
- Do not rewrite the original PR.
- Do not force-push.
- Do not disable, downgrade, or ignore anti-slop rules, and do not add `any`, widen a type, or add an assertion to satisfy a reviewer comment.
- Follow the same fix standards as the original batch task, described in `.opencode/commands/as-fixes.md` under "What a good fix looks like" and "Hard prohibitions". Read that section before editing. Review pressure is exactly when a laundered fix is most tempting.

After fixes, run:

`bun run deslop -- check-batch --run <run-id>`

Then re-run the package-scoped checks for the packages you touched, for example `bun run --cwd packages/ui type-check`, `bun run --cwd packages/ui lint`, and `bun run --cwd packages/ui test`. Workspace-wide checks are CI's job.

Delivery:
- Commit follow-up fixes with a concise message.
- Push the branch.
- Reply to addressed review comments using `gh`.
- For each specific review comment you addressed, reply with what was changed and the follow-up commit hash.
- If the feedback was a general PR comment, add one general PR comment summarizing what was addressed, commit hashes, and validation results.
- Update the PR description so it stays true for the final HEAD: refresh `## Validation` with the checks you re-ran, and move any new behavior change into `## Risks and failure behavior`. Keep every heading of `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` intact, and preserve content the repository owner added by hand, including screenshots. Read the live description before editing and merge into it rather than overwriting.
- If a comment is intentionally not addressed, reply with a concise reason.
- Do not release the batch while its PR is still open and awaiting review. The claim is what keeps parallel batches off these files.
- Release the batch only once its PR has been merged or closed: `bun run deslop -- release --run <run-id>`.
- After the follow-up is complete, switch back to `main` and pull the latest remote changes.

Constraints:
- Work on exactly one anti-slop batch PR.
- Prefer the oldest batch with an open PR.
- Do not auto-merge.
- Do not close the PR.
- Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`, package versions, or release metadata.
- Do not release or delete handoff directories for batches you did not handle.
- If validation fails and cannot be fixed safely within scope, leave the batch claimed and report the blocker.
